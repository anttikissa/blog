# Farewell to `<pre><code>`

<time datetime='2013-01-11T15:49:45.000Z'></time>

A popular way to express a code listing in HTML is to wrap it inside `<pre>` and
`<code>` elements.  For example, here's the canonical C program:

	#include <stdio.h>

	int main() {
		printf("Hello world!\n");
		return 0;
	}

To show that on a web page, we write the following HTML:

	<pre><code>#include <stdio.h>

		int main() {
			printf("Hello world!\n");
			return 0;
		}
	</code></pre>

This works, but has two downsides: 

* It requires the nesting of `<pre>` and `<code>` tags, which is ugly semantically
* It requires that the alignment of the first line is different from the others,
  which is ugly visually.

So from now on, I (and my _markup language_
(http://github.com/anttisykari/mk)) am going to write this instead:

	<pre class=code>
	#include <stdio.h>
	int main() {
		printf("Hello world!\n");
		return 0;
	}
	</pre>

This 

* is slightly shorter than the alternative,
* is more readable when viewing the source (we can put a a newline immediately
  after `<pre>` and _it will be stripped_
  (http://developers.whatwg.org/grouping-content.html#the-pre-element), and
* uses only one HTML element, which seems less wasteful

Arguably, `<pre><code>` is precisely what the HTML5 standard recommends -- I
suspect because it's a popular way to mark up code blocks.  On with the
revolution, then!

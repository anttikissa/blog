# On baseline grids

Some people, including authorities on typography such as Robert Bringhurst,
extol the virtues of maintaining a consistent vertical rhythm within a text.  By
this we mean that the text aligns on a baseline grid;  and even though we
deviate from this rhythm temporarily, say because of a quote or a subheading, we
should catch the exact same rhythm when resuming the running text.

This is illustrated on the _Typecast blog_
(http://typecast.com/blog/4-simple-steps-to-vertical-rhythm).

Thus, the mantra goes, we should _add or delete vertical space in measured
intervals_
(http://www.webtypography.net/Rhythm_and_Proportion/Vertical_Motion/2.2.2/),
including headings and subheadings where the font size and leading might be
different.

The problem arises from the fact that /if/ the leading of a heading is different
than the baseline measure, we'll have to restrict ourselves to a certain amount
of lines in headings if we wish to not disturb the vertical rhythm.

People are taking Bringhurst's advice (that is primarily intended for print
media) literally and applying it to the web, not taking into account that the
two media are different in nature.  First, if you design for print media, it
makes sense to make the page height a multiple of the leading and lay out the
text using the baseline grid.  Second, in print you usually have one or more
columns next to each other; in the case of books, you have two facing pages next
to each other.  A musical analogy would be two or more melodies playing at the
same time; the harmony is maximised when the two are in sync.

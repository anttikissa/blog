<h2>Where are we?</h2>

<p>Now it's a good time to take a look at the blog and observe some of its
shortcomings.

<ol>
<li>When writing a post (and when making changes to the server itself), you don't see the result instantaneously;
<li>there is no styling at all;
<li>the metadata is lacking (names and dates are missing);
<li>authoring in HTML is tedious;
<li>and it's not possible to insert other than text content (without resorting to third-party services).
</ol>

<p>In this session, we'll solve (1) and (2).

<h2>1. Making changes visible immediately</h2>

<p>Let's do a quick and dirty fix and restart the server
every second.  This will give us some downtime, but it's more than acceptable
during development.  This goes to the end of <code>server/run.js</code>:

<pre><code>server.listen(3000);

<b>setTimeout(function() { process.exit(0); }, 1000);</b>
</code></pre>

<p>To run the server, we now have to do:
<pre><code>% while ./server/run.js; do true; done</code></pre>

<p>which is pretty much how you would run a server in production anyway.

<p>While we're at it, let's write a script to keep the server running.  We'll
call it <code>run.sh</code>.

<pre><code>#!/bin/sh

cd $(dirname $0)

while ./server/run.js; do true; done
</code></pre>

The script uses <code>dirname</code> to find out where the script itself is
located, and changes the working directory to that.  Then it repeatedly runs the
server until it exits with an error code other than 0.  That means we'll have
to restart the runner if there is a compilation or runtime error.

<h2>2. Adding a little CSS</h2>

<p>We don't even have to touch the blog engine itself for this one; let's start
writing <code>preamble.html</code>.  We start with the usual HTML5 boilerplate.
(Note that we don't need to explicitly say <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> in
HTML5, so we won't.)

<pre><code>&lt;!doctype html&gt;
&lt;meta charset='utf-8'&gt;
&lt;title&gt;Blog&lt;/title&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>We embed the <code>&lt;style&gt;</code> tag, for now, to each served document
&ndash; perhaps not ideal for production use, but more than enough for now.

<p>To keep it simple, let's restrict ourselves to universally available fonts.
We won't go too fancy with the design, either, but that doesn't prevent us from
paying some attention to the details.

<p>Let's start with a more readable font, Palatino, and make it slightly
off-black on slightly off-white:

<pre><code>&lt;style&gt;
    body {
        color: #282828;
        background: #fdfdfd;
        font-family: Palatino, "Palatino Linotype";
    }
</code></pre>

<p>Then get rid of some of the default margins:

<pre><code>    body, div, p, ol, ul, li, h1, h2, h3 {
        margin: 0;
    }
</code></pre>

<p>After a while of fiddling in Fireworks, we arrive at suitable font selection
(16px Palatino combined with 15px Courier New on a 22px baseline grid, with
<code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> being 22px as well) and content width of 506px, which
makes the running text just shy of 70 characters per line.  While we're at it,
let's make images the same size by default.

Code listings like to be somewhat wider &ndash; we'll give them exactly 770
pixels.  These values come from a grid with 110px columns and 22px gutters:

<p><img style="margin-left: -286px; width: inherit;" alt='' src='http://f.cl.ly/items/2L0V1c1X21363H3T0j2g/grid.png'>

<p>This gives us a nice and readable, if not exceedingly original, starting point.

<pre><code>    body {
        line-height: 22px;
        width: 506px;
        margin: 0 auto;
    }
    img {
        display: block;
        width: 506px;
    }
    pre {
        width: 762px; /* with 2*4px padding (see below), 770px */
    }
    code {
        font-family: 'Courier New';
        font-size: 15px;
    }
    h1 {
        font-size: 22px;
        font-weight: normal;
    }
    h2, h3 {
        font-size: 16px;
    }
</code></pre>

<p>We derive the margins for the common elements from the baseline measure.
Lists and blockquotes demand some indentation; we use multiples of the base unit
(22 pixels).

<p>The <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> element needs some adjustment to fall on the same
baseline grid with the other text.

<pre><code>    h1, p, ul, ol, pre, footer {
        margin: 22px 0;
    }
    h1 {
        margin-top: 52px;
        position: relative;
        top: -2px;
    }
    blockquote {
        margin: 22px 44px;
    }
    ol, ul {
        padding: 0 0 0 44px;
    }
</code></pre>

<p><code>&lt;code&gt;</code> elements require some work in order to look just
right.  We'll want to let them stand out a bit from the other text by giving
them a slightly grey background.  <code>&lt;pre&gt;</code> elements are used to
contain code longer code listings, so they get the same treatment, and some additional side padding.

<pre><code>    code, pre {
        background: #f3f3f3;
    }
</code></pre>

<p>This alone would be just fine, but the inline <code>&lt;code&gt;</code> elements
still need some extra padding.  We also set their <code>line-height</code> to
just 18px, since that helps some browsers keep the baseline grid in sync (and
reduces the padding below the text).  The <code>border-top</code> style is used
to add a few pixels of extra padding above the element (except inside
<code>&lt;pre&gt;</code>).  

<p>The text color is tinted slightly towards blue so as to prevent it from
looking too dead.

<p>To make it look <em>just</em> right, we also need to tweak the position of
<code>&lt;pre&gt;</code>'s contents using <code>position: relative</code>, and
change the relative position of <code>&lt;pre&gt;</code> by a pixel or two using
some negative margin.  There.  (This is starting to get a bit too obsessive, so
we'll stop this madness right here.)

<pre><code>    pre {
        padding: 1px 4px 0 4px;
        margin-top: -2px;
    }

    code {
        padding: 0 2px;
        line-height: 18px;
        border-top: 3px solid #f3f3f3;
        color: #456;
    }

    pre > code {
        padding: 0;
        line-height: 22px;
        border-top: none;
    }
</code></pre>
<p>Finally, let's pick a color for the links.  Say, a nice lively green.
<pre><code>    a {
        color: #22b422;
        text-decoration: none;
        border-bottom: 1px solid #44d644;
    }

    a:hover {
        background: #efe;
        outline: 2px solid #efe;
    }

    a:active {
        background: #4e4;
        color: #efe;
        border: 1px solid #4e4;
        outline: none;
    }
&lt;/style&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Finally, we'll fix the placement of the navigation links and decorate them a bit.

<pre><code>    footer a.prev {
        float: left;
    }
        
    footer a.prev:before {
        content: '‹ ';
    }
 
    footer a.next {
        float: right;
    }
 
    footer a.next:after {
        content: ' ›';
    }
 
    footer {
        padding-bottom: 22px;
    }
</code></pre>

<p>There &ndash; looks nicer now.

<h2>Exercises</h2>

<ul>
	<li>Measure the downtime of the blog by printing out the time (as reported
	by, for example, <code>new Date().getTime()</code> just before restarting
	the server and just after <code>server.listen()</code>.  Alternatively,
	reload the site in the browser until you get a feel for how often it fails.  
	Is the downtime acceptable?  Come up with ways to make it smaller.  How
	could we avoid downtime altogether?

	<li>Learn all about web design and typography. Read <a

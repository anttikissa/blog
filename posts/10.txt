# Modifying the keyboard layout in OS X 

<time datetime='2013-01-30T16:09:42.979Z'></time>

This may be useful to you if you like to use the U.S. keyboard layout on OS X,
but need some keys from another layout (Finnish in my case).  Or perhaps you
just want to have quick access to some typographically fancy characters that
your current keyboard layout doesn't support.  Like ☞ these ☜.

I spent a while researching how to do this, so you wouldn't have to.

## The issue

The Finnish keyboard layout on OS X sucks.  As someone who grew up with the
Finnish PC layout, I find the placement of characters such as `[]{}\\|`
intolerable.  However, in Finnish you often need the characters å, ä (and
occasionally å), which have a prominent place on the Finnish keyboard.  (And the
Swedish keyboard, which happens to be the same.)

So I mainly used to use the U.S. keyboard, and switched to the Finnish one
occasionally.  This was suboptimal, since at any time the keyboard could be at
the wrong setting, causing little annoyances.

I decided to change my U.S. keyboard layout to generate å, ä and ö if I hold the
alt key<sup>†</sup> <span class=aside>† officially known as the "Option key", which is strange
when the text on the key reads "alt".</span> while pressing the same keys that
in the Finnish keyboard layout would generate them.

This is how you'd do it:

Download _Ukelele_
(http://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/page.php?site_id=nrsi&id=ukelele).

Open it, select File -> New From Current Input Source

Mapping the keys is a bit difficult; for each key combination, you:

* click Keyboard -> Edit Key
* select "Ok"
* click the key you want to remap, with modifiers (such as `Option-'`, which I'm
  planning to map to ä)
* type in the output (in this case, `ä`)

Once you've mapped what you need to map, save the keylayout to your home
directory and move it to `Library/Keyboard Layouts` using the terminal:

	> cp US_with_aao.keylayout Library/Keyboard\ Layouts/

Now you can go to System Preferences -> Keyboard -> Input Sources and forget the
other keyboards.

If you're Finnish (or Swedish), you may find my keyboard layout useful:
